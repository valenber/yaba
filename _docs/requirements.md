### Budgeting strategies

- [Best Apps 2023](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/best-budget-apps)

#### Tracking

This approach is based on tracking all expenses and income. The user has to enter
incoming and outgoing transactions. At the end of the budgeting period, the user
can review the transactions and see where the money went.

#### Zero-sum budgeting

This approach is based on distributing all income to different categories, such as
groceries, utilities, eating out, etc. The user has to set budgets for each category.
Once a category budget is used up no spending in this category is allowed. At the
end of the budgeting period, the user can review the categories and see whether the
budget was met.

#### Envelope budgeting

This approach is based on allocating all income to specific purposes, ensuring that
income minus expeses equals zero. A detailed bugdet document is created. The user
can then spend money from each envelope. At the end of the budgeting period, the
user can review the envelopes and see whether the budget was met.

### 50/30/20 budgeting

This approach is based on allocating 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants and 20%
to savings and dept repayment.
