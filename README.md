## Yet Another Budgeting App

Over the last year I developed a home budget management system to control
family expenses. I was using spreadsheets for it, but now I want to try to
transform this system into an app. It's going to be my first attempt at
full-stack project so I hope to learn a thing or two along the way.

## Todo

### exchange-service

- optimise Dockerfile
- cache the exchange rates (no need to query provider every time)
